The cursor is at 9000:ffc2.
The constant that gets added to it when the cursor moves is at 9000:ffac.
	This gets loaded dynamically somewhere?

Looks best when they're spaced out. So, can I get it to load the character at double the position of the cursor?

Cursor (0402) loaded into ECX.
Want it to get the character at 0802.
So, look for accesses to ch.

Change 6000:ab4c shl al, 01 to shl al, 02 (c0e002)?
	Hard to find out where to get that extra byte from... what if I nop out the "mov ch, 02"?
		c0e00203d890
	Next time ch gets used is a mov dl, ch instruction.
		6000:8ab8 8ad5 mov dl, ch
		Try this:
		b202 mov dl, 02
		Breaks everything.

Something that works:
	6000:aa07 80d700 adc bh, 00
	-> change to:
		10eb adc bl, ch
		90   nop
This doesn't seem to work on the second row/row 01... why?
	80f902 cmp cl, 02

	My hack isn't working when I edit that in MAIN.EXE. That instruction is probably in some DIETed file...
		It's in CMAKE.BIN at 0xa07...


The chars get moved depending on EDI. 96 thru 9b?

Moved to EAX, compared to 6 (max length)
6000:a9ef 3d0600 cmp ax, 0006
	Could probably increase this later.

d0b0s:
	0x62380
	0x6dc2

d1b0s:
	0xf325

d0e0 is at 0xaef in the original, uncdieted CMAKE.BIN.
	So I have been editing the already-dieted version...

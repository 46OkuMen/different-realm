DATA.BIN appears to have some important .TOS files squished together.

0x89b: name.tos, length is 0x30b
0xba7: item.tos, length is 0x7ea
0x1391: something unique to DATA.BIN?
0x1987: word.tos, length is 0x17f
0x1b07: monster.tos, length is 0x37f
End

Pointers at the top. 12 00, then (little-endian pointer, then 4 bytes of ??, then another pointer, etc)

There are TMP.TOS files in the rest of the SRC folders, they are probably other various TOS files...

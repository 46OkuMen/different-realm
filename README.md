Repository for 46 OkuMen's fan translation of `Different Realm`.

## Progress
* Just getting started here.

## Usage
* To decode the TOS files (and maybe dump them? but not very well):
```python decode_and_dump_tos.py```

* To dump the text from the decoded TOS files and put them in an Excel sheet:
```python dump_tos.py```

* To reinsert the text and apply ASM hacks:
```python reinsert.py```
